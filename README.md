# BFS_Visualisation

An application that visualises how `Breath First Search` works

I made this application to help me understand and visualise what BFS is actual doing

I might add some more features, maybe, I dont know \\\__(o_o)_/.

## What do the colours mean ?
- `Black` : Obstacles or walls
- `Red` : Unvisited cells
- `Green` : Cells in the queue
- `Blue` : visited cells

## How do you operate the appliation ?
* `H` - help (A box should pop up with some instructions on how to operate)
* `SPACE BAR` - to play or pause
* `R` - reset the winodw with random obstacles
* `C` - clears screens for blank screen to draw obstacles on
* `Q` - exits the applications
* `alt + left_click` - create your own obstacles
* `shift + left_click` - create your start point.
